# **Prompt 1: Input Constraint Logic**

**Goal:** Prevent the user from typing more dots/dashes than the current letter actually requires.

**Prompt:** "Let's add a strict input constraint. For the current letter being quizzed, the app should know exactly how many Morse characters (dots and dashes) make up its code.

1. Set a 'max length' for the input field equal to the length of the current letter's Morse code.  
2. Once that length is reached, the app should immediately validate the answer (don't wait for me to press Enter).  
3. Prevent any further typing or characters from being entered once the max length is hit."
