# Phase 1: The Foundation (Layout & Input)
Let's rebuild the classic mode of the Morse app to be a mastery-based trainer. Start by creating a clean, minimalist UI that displays a 'Current Set' of 1 letter out of a set of 4 letters (e.g., A, B, C, D). Show only  one letter at a time, show the character and its Morse code equivalent (dots and dashes). Below that, provide an input field where I can type the Morse code (using '.' and '-'). Add a listener so that when I finish typing a sequence, it will check if it matches the current letter I'm being quizzed on. No scoring yet—just get the display and the input matching logic working.
