# Task 1
We want to use the spacebar as a "tapper" as if we are on a morse code machine where a tapper is used to send morse code.  The spacebar will be used to send a dot or a dash.  

# Task 2
Hook this up in GCP
Create a home page where users can click a button to enter classic mode which is the current state or the user can click a button to enter AI mode which I willl explain below.

For AI mode, Gemini will choose a letter, or a word, or sentence, based on past performance so a user will improve their memory of morse code progressivly.

# Task 3 
Improve upon Task 2 AI Mode and more specifically, instead of using a fixed model version please include a dropdown so the user can choose the latest gemini and gemma models avaialbe from aistudio.google.com or models I have enabled in Vertex AI model garden in my GCP. 

# Task 4
Utilize a database to keep track of the users fluency on each morse code letter, word, and sentence. Show the user how many times they were succesful vs unsuccessful over time.
